# Storeable - Mobile Application for Grocery Store in  Barangay Sampaguita, Lipa City

## INTRODUCTION
Online shopping is getting more and more common for many different reasons. The rise in popularity of online shopping is undoubtedly influenced by external factors such as rising gas prices, transportation challenges, and the difficulties frequently associated with shopping malls and other traditional retailers. One of the terms that are most frequently used in the business sector is online shopping. Both emerging and developed nations use it frequently. Online shopping saves time which is efficient for modern people since people become so busy nowadays that they canâ€™t or are unwilling to spend much time shopping. In traditional shopping, there are some bindings or restrictions in buying products but in the case of online shopping, there are no bindings or limits. In contrast to the limitations or restrictions that come with traditional purchasing, there are no restrictions or limitations when using an online shopping app.

## STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
The COVID-19 crisis saw a rise in the digital economy. People went to the internet purchasing more frequently than ever before as they embraced social withdrawal. 67 percent of consumers claim that COVID-19 has changed the way they shop. Retailers met the threat head-on, not just by encouraging greater online purchases but also by embracing cutting-edge  technologies that connected with customers or improved the shopping experience. 
There are 2,645 houses and 10,910 people living in Barangay Sampaguita in Lipa City, and the majority of them shop at the Coop Supermarket. Since the residents would be exposed to the outside environment during the pandemic, it is important to consider everyone's safety at this time. Additionally, purchasing from a physical store can take a lot of time, which is inefficient for those who need to run errands.

## EXPECTED OUPUT
As a result, Storeable, a mobile application for grocery stores, will be developed  so that residents of Barangay Sampaguita can easily order any item from a grocery store online and have it delivered right to their door steps. Storeable will be intended to keep track of and assist shoppers with their day-to-day demands without overwhelming them. 


## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Project:

These SDGs are further described as follows;
